        "description": "The desert country of Saudia Arabia highly relies on irrigation farming for growing crops due to its arrid and warm climate. The cirular shape of the fields is a result of the irrigation system (center-pivot irrigation) which uses water from a huge fossile aquifer. The size of the field ranges from few hundret meters up to almost one kilomiter, limited by the size of the irrigation system. What started more then 40 years ago as a huge success story, ensuring domestic food security for the kindgom, is becoming more and more problematic as the once rich water reserves are depleting. As a result Saudia Arabia is bying more and more fields abroad to satisfy the domestic demand.

        "description": "Due to fertile soils and regular floodings, the Nile river basin has supported agriculture for thousands of years. Close to 90 per cent of the land currently used for agriculture is under rainfed farming systems (farming systems, that rely on rainfall). These systems are characterized by subsistence-level production and low yields of crops and livestock. There is about 5.6 million hectares of land under irrigation or equipped with irrigation facilities in the Nile Basin. A large proportion – 97 per cent – of the land is located in Egypt and The Sudan. Three countries – Egypt, Tanzania, and Uganda – produce large quantities of fish, but the freshwater fisheries resources of the basin are showing signs of being overfished. The top three crops grown in the basin are wheat, fodder and maize. Livestock farming is also thriving, Ethiopia leading with more than 50 million heads of cattle.
