### Agriculture in Saudi Arabia (Moisture Index)

The desert country of Saudi Arabia highly relies on irrigation farming for growing crops due to its arid and warm climate. The circular shape of the fields is a result of the irrigation system (center-pivot irrigation) which uses water from a huge fossil aquifer. The size of the field ranges from few hundred meters up to almost one kilometer, limited by the size of the irrigation system. What started more than 40 years ago as a huge success story, ensuring domestic food security for the kingdom, is becoming more and more problematic as the once rich water reserves are depleting. As a result, Saudi Arabia is buying more and more fields abroad to satisfy the domestic demand.

### Agriculture in Italy (Barren Soil)

[Veneto agriculture](https://www.recare-hub.eu/news/45-06-bioforsk) is one of the most productive in Italy, producing mainly cereals, fruits and wine. Small, hand farmed fields present a contrast to the growing industrialization of the sector, which suffers from soil degradation. The Barren Soil visualization shows that in the middle of spring still a lot of fields lie fallow indicated by the red color. 

### Agriculture in California (NDVI)

The [Central Valley](https://ca.water.usgs.gov/projects/central-valley/about-central-valley.html), west of California’s famous Sierra Nevada is home to the states biggest and most important agricultural region. The fields are irrigated on the one hand with water from the two major rivers of the valley (Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers) on the other hand with ground water. Despite using less then 1% of the nation’s total farmland, the valley produces 25% of U.S. food. In total more then 250 different crops are grown, the most important being cereal grains, hay, cotton, different fruits and vegetable and nuts.

### Agriculture along the Nile river (EVI)

Due to fertile soils and regular flooding, the Nile river basin has supported agriculture for thousands of years. Close to 90 per cent of the land currently used for agriculture is under rainfed farming systems (farming systems, that rely on rainfall). These systems are characterized by subsistence-level production and low yields of crops and livestock. There is about 5.6 million hectares of land under irrigation or equipped with irrigation facilities in the Nile Basin. A large proportion – 97 per cent – of the land is located in Egypt and The Sudan. Three countries – Egypt, Tanzania, and Uganda – produce large quantities of fish, but the freshwater fisheries resources of the basin are showing signs of being overfished. The top three crops grown in the basin are wheat, fodder and maize. Livestock farming is also thriving, Ethiopia leading with more than 50 million heads of cattle.

### Agriculture in Limpopo (Enhanced True Color)

[<img src="fig/Limpopo_Agriculture_thumbnail.jpg" align="right" width="240">](https://www.flickr.com/photos/sentinelhub/49101283122/in/dateposted/) South African agriculture's biggest challenge is the absence of water since rainfall doesn't come regularly. Hence, many agricultural fields are irrigated, helping make Limpopo an important part of the country's agriculture.
