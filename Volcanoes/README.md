## Included pins 

### Kilauea (Wildfires Pierre Markuse)

Kilauea is the world's most active volcanic mass, with its caldera some 10 square kilometers large, and 150 meters deep. Kilauea's eruptions are usually non-explosive, as is typical for shield volcanoes. However, in 1790, a steam explosion killed a part of the army marching near the caldera. One of the most destructive eruptions happened in 1955, when lava was pouring out of the caldera for 88 consecutive days, destroying valuable sugar cane fields. An eruption in 1975 was followed by a destructive tsunami. In 2018, the east rift zone of Kilauea erupted, with earthquake hitting the neighbouring Puna. Lava flows reached the sea,  burning roads and buildings on its way, forcing many people to evacuate. Due to emitting methane gas, the fire in some areas burned blue.

### Etna (False Color Urban)

[Mount Etna](https://www.britannica.com/place/Mount-Etna) on the Italian island of Sicily is the highest active volcano in Europe. At the moment it reaches a height of 3320 meters (changes due to depositions from eruptions and collapses of the crater) and covers an impressive area of 1600 km<sup>2</sup>.  Its lower slopes host vineyards, olive groves, and orchards. Surrounding the foot of the volcano several smaller and bigger settlements can be found. Mount Etna is currently and through the centuries very active only in the last five year having had four strombolian eruptions.

### Stromboli, Province of Messina, Italy (False Color Urban)

[<img src="fig/Stromboli_thumbnail.jpg" align="right" width="240">](https://www.flickr.com/photos/sentinelhub/50082808651/in/dateposted/)[Stromboli](https://www.volcanodiscovery.com/stromboli.html) has been active consistently for at least 2000 years, which is unusual among volcanoes.  Most of its activity consists of brief and smaller bursts of lava 100-200 meters high into the air. Occasionally, longer periods of eruptions occur, lasting from a few to up to 10 years. The most recent one began in December 2002 and ended in July 2003. Although Stromboli's eruptions are not dangerous for the most part, more violent eruptions that take lives and destroy property, do occur. In [July 2019](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-48857422), a hiker died during the eruption, several people were injured and many had to flee to the sea. The deadliest [eruption in 1930](http://www.geo.mtu.edu/volcanoes/boris/mirror/mirrored_html/STROMBOLI-1930.html) took 6 lives and caused considerable damage. 

### Jebel Marra, Sudan (not active)

[<img src="fig/Jebel_Marra_thumbnail.jpg" align="right" width="240">](https://www.flickr.com/photos/sentinelhub/49126817116/in/dateposted/) You're looking at the dormant Jebel Marra volcano in Sudan. The most prominent feature of this mountain is the volcanic caldera, called Deriba Caldera. In its heart lie two volcanic lakes, formed some 3.500 years ago, as the eruptions removed rock material and created a crater. The lakes are supplied by rain and hot springs.
